## LVDM Dataset

The LVDM dataset is introduced in our paper titled “STD-Net: Spatio-Temporal Decomposition Network for Video Demoiréing with Sparse Transformers,” published in the IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology (TCSVT) in 2024.

The dataset is currently in the process of being organized and will soon be made publicly available.
